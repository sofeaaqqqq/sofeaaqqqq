My visit to Johor Port Berhad provided valuable insight into how its ICT department supports digital transformation. I learned about their use of low-code platforms to accelerate application development and integrated systems such as JBPI, ERP RAMCO, and PAMS to streamline port operations and data flow. I was particularly impressed by their strong focus on cybersecurity and personal data protection, including 24/7 Security Operations Centre monitoring and regular vulnerability assessments. Overall, the visit showed how Johor Port combines modern technology with robust security practices to remain efficient and reliable.
